torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.54 GiB of which 2.44 MiB is free. Process 695355 has 656.00 MiB memory in use. Process 699115 has 21.37 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 1.48 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 931.24 MiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 138.76 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
